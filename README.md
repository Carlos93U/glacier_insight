# GlacierInsight

## Project Overview
**GlacierInsight** is a computer vision project aimed at analyzing and documenting the gradual disintegration of a glacier in [your countryâ€™s name], driven by climate change. Using advanced image analysis techniques with OpenCV, this project tracks changes in glacier structure, aiming to raise awareness about environmental transformation and contribute valuable data to support policy-making on climate action.

## Motivation
As glaciers recede globally, their reduction signals significant environmental shifts impacting ecosystems and water resources. **GlacierInsight** seeks to highlight these transformations and provide visual evidence of glacier reduction over time, underscoring the urgent need for environmental awareness and action.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of **GlacierInsight** is to analyze satellite imagery to detect, document, and visualize the transformation of the glacier in [specific location or name of glacier if available]. This project will create a visual record of glacier changes over time, presenting a data-driven perspective on the effects of climate change.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and analysis
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **NumPy and Pandas**: For data handling and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: For visual representation of data and changes
- **Google Earth Engine** (optional): To obtain satellite images and monitor updates

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains raw and processed images of the glacier.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for automated image processing.
- **output/**: Results, graphs, and any processed visuals.
- **docs/**: Documentation, including research and findings.
